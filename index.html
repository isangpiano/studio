The Piano Studio of Isabelle Ang offers private piano lessons to students of all ages/abilities in Palo Alto, California.

Under Isabelle's teaching, students experience firsthand that music is a creative art as well as an interpretive art. They learn not only learn how to express themselves through artistic performances of various styles of music, but they also learn how to make their own music through improvisation and composition. If you are looking for top-quality musical instruction that will give the student a life-long understand and appreciation of music, you will find it here!
I’ve been offering comprehensive and affordable private lessons in Palo Alto since 2000. My job is a passion for me, and it brings me joy to be able to share this passion with my students. From day one, they learn important foundational techniques to help them boost their skills and self-esteem. Each one has a unique learning style, and it’s my duty to find out what that is and adapt my lessons accordingly. Contact me today to learn how I can help you achieve your academic goals.

						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions
</h2>
					</header>
					<p>How long is your lesson?
Lessons will be held once a week for 30 mins, 45 mins and 60 mins. Students should arrive on time and prepared with all music books needed for the lesson.
Where do you hold your lessons?
Enter the answer to your question here. Be thoughtful with your answer, write clearly, and consider adding examples.
Do you have specific teaching qualifications?
I have a Master degree in Music Education from Penn State University, specialized in early childhood music education. I have a bachelor degree in piano performance from National Taiwan Normal University.
I thought in elementary and middle school class before
Do you make up for lesson?
When you register for lessons, your timeslot is reserved for you for the following quarter. In the event that student has to miss a lesson because of an emergency or illness, please contact me with as much advance notice as possible. Then a make-up lesson will be scheduled at the earliest possible date.
What kind of piano is suitable?
All students must have a piano or digital piano for home practice.
Do you have group class or studio recital?
Yes, and it is an excited time for students! There will be a recital and studio group lesson offer every school year. Students are encouraged to participate to demonstrate their learning progress and to share their music with friends and family members.
How often do I need to practice?
Regular home practice is essential for student success. Ideally, students should aim for at least 5 days of practice each week. Short, daily practice sessions are more effective than one or two long sessions per week. The most important time for students to practice is right after their weekly lesson, to solidify what they have just learned. Parental involvement in home practice is crucial for student success. Please help your children to establish and stick to a practice routine, and see that practice time is free of distractions. If you are the parent of an elementary age student, please plan to sit with your child for at least a portion of their daily practice time.</p>
